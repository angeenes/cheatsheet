# JavaScript ES14 Features

As of now, ES14 is still in the proposal stage, with features being discussed and reviewed by the TC39 committee. Some anticipated features include:

1. **Pattern Matching (Proposed)** - Enables more expressive control structures using pattern matching.
```javascript
// Example usage (hypothetical)
const result = match (value) {
  when { type: 'success', data } => `Success: ${data}`,
  when { type: 'error', message } => `Error: ${message}`,
  else => 'Unknown',
};
console.log(result);
```

2. **Immutable Collections (Proposed)** - New APIs for creating and working with immutable data structures.
```javascript
// Hypothetical example
const immutableMap = ImmutableMap.from({ a: 1, b: 2 });
console.log(immutableMap.get('a')); // Outputs: 1
```

3. **Additional Updates** - Check the [ECMAScript Proposals Repository](https://github.com/tc39/proposals) for up-to-date information.
